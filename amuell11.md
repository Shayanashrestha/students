Hello, My name is Andrew Mueller. I am Masters student in which this will be my last semester here at UTK. I am also a graduate teaching assistant for COSC 202 this semester. I am interested in more lower level programming, but have not really touched anything about it. I am hoping to get my hands more dirty with it this semester is possible!
